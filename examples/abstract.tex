\begin{abstract}
There are several key components of health, which can be monitored through means of body composition
and shape analysis. Metrics such as fat mass index and fat free mass index are simple features of the human body that can aid our understanding in their overall health. How these are measured have been extensively studied throughout the years. Means such as DXA and bioimpedance can accurately measure body fat. While more recently, 3d optical imaging has been shown to be a promising alternative whilst providing benefits such as lower cost. The Shepherd Lab has demonstrated such findings by showing similar results between DXA and 3d optical imaging. The project is ongoing and this thesis is the culmination of my progress relating to 3d optical imaging methods and testing for applications in space. It provides an overview of my work and the starting point of much future effort.

Through experiments, we optimize the equipment/settings/configuration/parameters to maximize the performance of sensors and our imaging system for use in a parabolic flight setup utilizing microgravity simulation protocols to improve the measurement of health metrics through both performance and speed. I show the importance of settings such as frame rate, resolution, and noise. Of which, the d435 sensor performs the best. With regards to the imaging configuration, I document the relationship between certain settings and the resulting 3d reconstruction using quantitative metrics. I create a system that can be used on a parabolic flight with microgravity and future testing further out in space. And I train several models for learning body fat using a graph neural network, extreme gradient boosted decision trees, and produce a system for the first automated caesar dataset landmark placement using deep learning which may hopefully greatly accelerate any pipelines that use this for template registration.
