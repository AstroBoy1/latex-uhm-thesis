\begin{abstract}
There are several key components of health, which can be monitored through means of body composition
and shape analysis. Metrics such as fat mass index and fat free mass index are simple features of the humany body that can aid our understanding in their overall health. How these are measured have been extensively studied throughout the years. Means such as DXA and bioimpedance can accurately measure body fat. While more recently, 3d imaging has proven to be able to match the performance of its predecessors whilst providing certain benefits such as lower cost. The Shepherd Lab has demonstrated such findings by showing similar results between DXA and 3d imaging. The project is ongoing and this thesisis is the culmination of my progress relating to 3d imaging methods and testing for applications in space. It provides an overview of my work and the starting point of much future effort.

A brief overview of this work includes sensor testing, imaging configuration, a parabolic flight setup, microgravity simulation protocols, and improving the measurment of health metrics through both performance and speed. I show the importance of settings such as frame rate, resolution, and noise. Of which, the d435 sensor performs the best. With regards to the imaging configuration, I show these settings in use and the impact on the resulting 3d reconstruction. I create a system that can be used on a parabolic flight. And I also train several models for learning body fat using a graph neural network, extreme gradient boosted decision trees, and show results for the first deep learning automated caesar dataset landmark placement.
